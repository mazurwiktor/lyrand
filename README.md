# what?

A bunch of scripts to generate lyrics out of the tracks from your playlists.

# how?

1. convert Spotify playlist to .csv file with https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify
2. fetch lyrics with **download** module
3. generate new lyrics **generate** module

To use **generate** steps 1. and 2. are not required, just feed the script with your own .json file (see generate/README.md for data layout).
